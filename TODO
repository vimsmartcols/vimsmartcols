vimsmartcols

1. Visual mode: select a block of text, then attempt to make
   all rows in the block match columns in a reasonable way.

2. Allow numerical modifiers. For example, 4| would mean
   "auto-align me with the row four rows above me." +3> would mean
   "shift right to next column 3 rows below me."

3. Optional, smart autocmd feature. Auto-aligns columns of rows
   above and below you as you edit this one, if they're aligned.

4. In general, smarter detection of what are columns and which ones
   match up, possibly using repeated characters like ',' or '='.
