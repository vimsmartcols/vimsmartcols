:nmap \| :call Aligncol()<CR>

"
" TLDR:
" anything separated by two spaces or more is a "column"
"
" Normal mode:  >           pushes right to match column in row above
"               <           pushes left to match column in row above
"               |           attempts to align all rows to match row above
" Insert mode:  Shift-TAB   pushes right to match column in row above
"
"---------------------------------------
 
" Examples:
"
" >> Start with the following lines: we're in the middle of adding
" >> a second row.
"
" x = {  7,      8,      9,     10,     11,
"  12,  13,  14,  15,
"
" >> Move cursor to the 12 and press '>' to align 12 with next column.
"
" x = {  7,      8,      9,     10,     11,
"        12,  13,  14,  15,
"
" >> Go to end of line and press 'a' to enter insert mode.
" >> Press Shift-TAB twice to move to last column and type '16};'.
" 
" x = {  7,      8,      9,     10,     11,
"        12,  13,  14,  15,             16};
"
" >> Press ESC to exit insert mode, press 'b' to move to the beginning of
" 16, and press '<' to align it with the previous column.
"
" x = {  7,      8,      9,     10,     11,
"        12,  13,  14,  15,     16};
"
" >> Press '|' to auto-align all columns.
"
" x = {  7,      8,      9,     10,     11,
"        12,     13,     14,    15,     16};
